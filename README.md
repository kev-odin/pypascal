Building an interpretter based on the groundwork provided by https://ruslanspivak.com/

I worked through blog series over the course of a couple months. I decided to take on this project because I wanted to learn about how programming languages
worked. During my learning experience, I implemented some software design patterns and seperated key functionality to make the overall program easier to
maintain. 

Currently, I am still actively working on this project because I love learning and want to further my skills as a Software Engineer.

TO-DO LIST
* Finish writing unit tests
* Add more Pascal files to test
* Centralize the AST to handle other Node types
* Refactor parser code to be less redundant
